# CNN-Based-Candlestick-Patterns-Recognition-and-Stock-Trend-Prediction

Candlestick charts, with their rich visual representation of price action, have long been employed by
traders to gauge market sentiment and forecast potential price trends. The patterns formed by
candlesticks contain valuable information about the dynamics between buyers and sellers, offering
insights into market psychology and momentum.

However, we often find different market participants have totally different interpretations of the same
candlestick chart. Moreover, manual interpretation of these charts is not only subject to human biases
and limitations but also time-consuming given the fast-moving nature of the capital markets.
Fortunately, the surge in computational power and progression in machine learning / artificial
intelligence techniques has enabled us to explore automated methods to extract meaningful signals from
candlestick charts. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to conduct candlestick chart
analysis, market participants would possibly gain a competitive edge in navigating volatile markets.
Moreover, the potential impacts extend beyond individuals to the whole market, because the market
mispricing will be eliminated more swiftly and accurately, fostering a more efficient market.

In light of these considerations, this report aims to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of employing
CNNs for candlestick chart recognition in predicting stock price trends. We found that despite some
inherent limitations of computational resources, the CNN models are useful for predicting stock price
trends by extracting features from candlestick charts.
